• You can execute my solution by opening 'index.html' in your browser.

	○ The 'default' folder is my preferred solution.

	○ The 'no-ie' folder is more minimalist, but lacks IE support.

	○ The 'angular' folder employs AngularJS, in case you prefer a more
	  framework-based solution.

• Cross-browser compatibility:

	○ Desktop: Chrome 34, Firefox 29, IE 8-10 (gracefully degrades).

	○ Mobile: Android, iPhone (iOS 7).

• Javascript passes JSLINT.

• Accessibility

	○ All IMG tags have ALT text.

• If I had more time...

	○ I would improve accessibility by adding aria-* tags. For example,
	  I'd add 'aria-selected' to the article when the user selects it,
	  so that the screen-reader can signal the selection to vision-
	  impaired users.
